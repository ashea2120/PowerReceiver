## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
- Registers a BroadcastReceiver object which displays a Toast message every time power is connected or disconnected
  * The Toast message is a separate custom broadcast 
  * Learned how to send and receive custom broadcasts which was either a normal, local, or ordered broadcasts (even though this lesson didn't cover ordered broadcasts)
-  Learned about System Broadcasts - which Android sends when a system event occurs
- Learned how to register and unregister a receiver and how to correctly override the onReceive() and onStop()
